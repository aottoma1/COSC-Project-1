My target OS was Windows with default browser Chrome but has a backup option if default on specific OS isn't chrome!

I used ai as an assistant to help me code things that I wasn't sure how to do in rust, as well as the extra credit and opening in a browser. Both of those are things I have never done before and would never have known how to do. AI was particularly helpful in debugging when the grammar wasn't working properly in my code.
